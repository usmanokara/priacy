    <p><strong>Effective:</strong> 10/09/2025</p>

    <p>Landora Studios LLC is committed to protecting children from sexual abuse, exploitation, and other harms. This page describes our published standards, reporting channels, handling of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and legal compliance procedures. This resource is provided to satisfy platform requirements and to help users and authorities understand how we respond to child safety concerns. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

    <h2>1. Scope & statement</h2>
    <p>We explicitly prohibit Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) and Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) in our app and services. Any content or behavior that promotes, depicts, or facilitates CSAE/CSAM is forbidden and will be removed and reported as required by law and platform policy. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>

    <h2>2. Published standards (what we publish)</h2>
    <p>Our public standards include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An explicit prohibition on CSAE and CSAM.</li>
      <li>A clear explanation of the types of prohibited content and behavior (text, images, video, links, solicitation, grooming, and distribution of CSAM).</li>
      <li>How users can report suspected CSAE/CSAM or other child safety concerns.</li>
      <li>How we review reports and the types of actions we take (content removal, account action, cooperation with law enforcement).</li>
      <li>Data retention and preservation procedures for reported incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. In-app reporting</h2>
    <p>The App provides users with an in-app reporting flow so concerns can be raised directly from within the product (no need to leave the app):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Report button on content and user profile screens.</li>
      <li>Help → Report flow available in the app menu.</li>
      <li>When a user files a report we capture: reporter contact (optional), content ID or URL, description, and any attached evidence the reporter supplies.</li>
      <li>Reports may also be sent by email if a user prefers (contact below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. CSAM handling & escalation</h2>
    <p>We follow a strict procedure for suspected CSAM and CSAE:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate removal or isolation of content suspected to be CSAM.</li>
      <li>Preservation of relevant metadata and content for lawful requests (timestamps, user IDs, content IDs, IP logs) while minimizing access to non-essential data.</li>
      <li>Prompt escalation to law enforcement when legally required or when content indicates immediate risk to a child.</li>
      <li>Reporting to platform-specified channels and trusted reporting bodies where applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Legal compliance & cooperation</h2>
    <p>We comply with applicable laws and work with law enforcement and child protection agencies when required. This includes responding to valid legal process and government requests for information related to child
