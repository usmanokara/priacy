This version aligns with your **Home Inventory Tool** branding, references property data specifically, and follows legal/retention standards mentioned in your Terms.

If you want, I can also **create a short version suitable for the app Settings page** that’s user-friendly and mobile-optimized. Do you want me to do that?
